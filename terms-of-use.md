			7. PAYMENTS AND METHODS OF PAYMENT
		</p>
		<p>
			7.1 Overview.
		</p>
		<p>
			Organizers may allow Students to make payment through the Site as follows: (1) by check or money order directly to Organizer,  and (2) "Credit Card Processing" or “CCP”, which requires the use of the Gateway for the collection of Course Registration Fees.
		</p>
		<p>
			7.2 Direct Payment by Buyers
		</p>
		<p>
			Organizers will collect all monies directly from Students under the check option. By registering for and using the check option, you agree to accept the responsibility for receiving funds via check and providing refunds to Students at your own discretion. Haiku will not be responsible or liable for refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the check option.
		</p>
		<p>
			7.3 Credit Card Processing
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) Gateway; Payment Process.
		</p>
		<p>
			If an Organizer elects to use the CCP, and a Student pays a Course Registration Fee by credit card, payment processing occurs through the Gateway. If a Student pays a Course Registration Fee by credit card, Haiku will collect the Course Registration Fees from the Student on behalf of the Organizer and shall remit these fees to Organizer, after deducting all applicable Services Fees, within three business days of the next Disbursement Deadline.  Disbursement Deadlines are the 1st and the 15th of the month after the Course Registration Fee is deposited into Haiku’s merchant bank account. Haiku shall remit the Course Registration Fees to Organizer by [electronic funds transfer]. An itemized statement will be sent contemporaneously with the payment remittance, detailing the Course Registration Fees received and Service Fees withheld  for all transactions during the last period. All Course Registration Fees for a given course are earned by Organizer upon completion of the registration process by Student but will be paid to Organizer be net of all Service Fees.
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) Refunds.
		</p>
		<p>
			(1) It is the responsibility of the Organizer to communicate its refund policy to Students and Haiku in the refund policy page on the Site. Organizer shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of this TOS. In the event any Course is non-refundable, Organizer shall clearly provide that notification in the Organizer Content. If a Student requests a refund of the Course Registration Fees from Organizer, Organizer shall directly issue refunds to Students via the Site, provided the refund is issued by Organizer within sixty (60) days after payment of the Course Registration Fee, or by check at any time. Refunds requested or issued following such sixty (60) day period will not be processed through the Site, unless otherwise agreed to by Haiku in its sole discretion and will need to be processed by Organizer directly with the Student.  If a Student requests a refund directly from Haiku, Haiku shall forward all such requests directly to Organizer and Organizer shall have sole responsibility to address such refund with the Student in accordance with the above policies.  If Organizer issues a refund to a Student via the Site, and if such Course Registration Fee has already been remitted by Haiku to Organizer, upon charge to Haiku’s account of such amount, Haiku will issue a statement to Organizer for payment of such refunded amount and Haiku may offset such amount from the next payment due to Organizer. If the Course Registration Fee had not already been remitted by Haiku to Organizer, then Haiku shall net the amount to be paid to Organizer against the amount to be refunded to Haiku, will issue a statement to Organizer setting forth both transactions and Haiku may offset such amount from the next payment due to Organizer.
		</p>
		<p>
			If Organizer cancels a Course, it shall directly refund the Course Registration Fees to the Student either via delivery of check or through the Site and refunds shall be addressed as set forth in the previous paragraph.  In the event that refunds (due to refunds and/or course cancellations) exceed $10,000 in any one (1) month, a service fee of 3.5% will be applied to refunded amounts and shall be paid to Haiku by the Organizer within thirty (30) days of being invoiced.
		</p>
		<p>
			All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and Student, and Haiku will not be responsible or liable for them, unless caused by Haiku’s negligence or willful misconduct.
		</p>
		<p>
			All sales, fees, charges, and funds are payable in U.S. Dollars.

			(c) Credit Card Chargebacks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the CCP option, any credit card chargebacks initiated by a Student’s merchant bank for any reason with respect to a course shall be the responsibility of the Organizer of such event. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks are between the Organizer and Student, and Haiku will not be responsible or liable in any way for them, unless caused by Haiku’s negligence or willful misconduct. Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Haiku and its affiliates for, chargebacks initiated by a Student’s merchant bank with the process to be the same as issuing a refund under Section 7.3(b) of this Agreement.
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) Confirmation of Course Registration
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon receipt of a credit card authorization from each individual course registration, Haiku generates a confirmation message and issues a unique confirmation number.
