# Haiku Learning API Terms of Use

_Effective Date: July 1, 2015_

Our API allows other developers to integrate with and extend Haiku Learning. We're continuously expanding our API. It currently enables our corporate customers to tightly integrate Haiku Learning with their existing student information or content management systems (e.g. instantly creating and maintaining User, Class, and Roster data via our Import API).

## Modifications to Policy

Haiku Learning reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify this Haiku Learning API Policy at any time. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications. Modifications are effective when first posted. To receive notifications about changes to this policy and the Haiku Learning API functionality, see the “Deprecation and API Changes” section below.

## General Principles

Applications that access the Haiku Learning API should adhere to the following principles:

* Don't do bad things to Haiku Learning or other users.
* Don't pretend to be someone else.
* Don't do anything unexpected to users.
* Respect the privacy of users.
* Don't spam or overwhelm users.
* Additionally, your applications must adhere to Haiku Learning API rate limits (see the “API Rate Limits” section below).

Don't pretend to be someone else.

* Do not pretend to be Haiku Learning or any other organization using Haiku Learning.
* Do not mislead, confuse, or deceive users by pretending to be someone else.
* It should be clear to end users that your application is an independent resource integrated with Haiku Learning.
* Don't do anything unexpected to users.

Your application must not…

* Use the Haiku Learning API for purposes other than what your application states or implies
* Use the Haiku Learning API on behalf of any third-party outside of your school or organization
* Facilitate or encourage the publishing of links to malicious or obscene content
* Your service should outline what actions your application will take on the user's behalf as part of the application registration process.

Respect the privacy of users.

* Any user data—including grades, roster membership, profiles, etc.—retrieved through the Haiku Learning API should be considered private data and, in some cases, will be protected by federal regulations such as FERPA and COPPA.
* Be transparent with end users about what information will be disclosed.
* Do not publish private or confidential information.
* Respect the intellectual property rights of others.
* Don't spam or overwhelm users.

Push information as rarely as possible, both to minimize user annoyance and make your pushes more effective.

## API Rate Limits

Applications that access the Haiku Learning API must limit calls as follows:

In order to make sure all users have speedy access to Haiku Learning, the API throttles users sending more than 30 requests per 15 seconds.

* While we may adjust these throttling limits in the future, we will always allow enough requests to keep the API functional.

## API Changes and Deprecation

The Haiku Learning API is versioned to allow for future enhancements. When Haiku Learning may change or remove existing endpoints or fields in API, Haiku Learning will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least 60-days notice of any material, permanent suspension or discontinuation of API functionality.

* Haiku Learning may add new API endpoints or fields in API results without prior notice to Customer.
* Haiku Learning has no liability to Customer as a result of any change, temporary unavailability, suspension, or termination of access to the API.
